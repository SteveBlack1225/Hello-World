# Hello-World
First project using ASP.NET 
Recently received my Associates Degree as a computer programmer/analyst from Lansing Community College, but didn't learn anything about asp.net during that coursework. Now trying my first paid programming and Visual Studio wants me to use asp.net to develop the program, so I'm working my way through the tutorial steps.
